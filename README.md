# CSS Fundamentals Lab

## Objectives

- Link an external CSS file
- Write CSS rules to style HTML


## Getting Started

Open 'CSS_Debrief/css-fundamentals'

## Link an External CSS File

Link the 'style.css' file to the 'index.html' file. Refer to the 'completed_example' to complete the below tasks

### Deliverables

- **Update the header**: the text is a little wonky being aligned on the left
  like that. Provide a property that aligns it in the center instead.

- **Center our image**: We only have one image on the page and we would like it
  centered!

- **Jazz up our navigation links**: Let's center all of our nav links as well.
  Give all of the `<a>` tags within our navbar padding of 10px on their left and
  right sides. In addition, change their background color to something of your
  choosing. We chose grey!

- **Our image caption needs work**: Let's shrink that font size down and make
  sure it is centered.

- **Update the text block**: Wouldn't it look nicer if our text was centered as
  well? Our image is about 900px wide, so let's give all our `<p>`s within
  `#featured-property` a hard width of 800px and center the text in there. Be
  sure to keep a little vertical space around the `<p>`s.

- **Make our `#details` section horizontal**: The details section could go
  nicely as a footer to the page, instead of a vertical list. To do this, make
  each of the `<div>`s `float` to the `left`.

- **As a finishing touch**: Let's clean up the `<div>`s at the bottom of the
  page. All of them should have the same background color, centered text, and
  occupy 25% of the `width` of the bottom row (since we have 4 divs).

# My Little Rainbow

## Objectives

- Review HTML basics
- Review CSS basics
- Specify hexadecimal color values with CSS


## Getting Started

Open 'CSS_Debrief/css-rainbow'

## Make a CSS Rainbow 

In the directory, you'll see two files: `index.html`, `main.css`, and this
file. Open `index.html`.

If everything is working correctly, you should see a white page.

Good job!


### Coloring the Rainbow

To get ROYGBIV onto our rainbow we'll need seven hex colors. Red: `#f00`;
Orange: `#ffa500`; Yellow: `#ff0`; Green: `#00bc3f`; Blue: `#06f`; Indigo:
`#8a2be2`; Violet: `#d300c9`

All we have to do next is select each div individually and apply each of those
colors. That is a perfect use for ids since they're meant to style one specific
element only. We need to add an id for each div so a logical name for each div
would be the color that they have to be. It could be something random, but good
names make for semantic code. So let's give the outermost div the id red.

```html
<div id="red">...</div>
```

To give that id some CSS attributes we'll go into `main.css`, select the id, and
mark its color as red.

```css
#red {
  /* this selects any elements with the red id */
  border-top-color: #f00;
}
```

To make sure the rainbow isn't so monochromatic you now need to repeat the above
steps with the final six colors, and when you do you should have a complete,
colorful rainbow.

# CSS Kitten Wheelbarrow

## Objectives

- Position elements absolutely
- Practice using CSS selectors

Oh no! All of our kittens have escaped from the wheelbarrow and we need to get
them back in. Help collect all the kittens and put them into the wheelbarrow
using CSS selectors and absolute positioning.

## Getting Started

Open 'CSS_Debrief/css-kittens'

## Position Elements Absolutely

There are a few different ways we can use CSS to position elements in our web
pages. _Absolute_ positioning means placing the element in its containing
element in a certain location that will stay the same no matter where other
elements are placed. We can use absolute positioning to specify _exactly_ where
in the document layout we want an element to be placed:

![absolute positioning diagram](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/phase-0-css-kitten-lab/absolute-position.png)

Here's an example of what absolute positioning looks like in CSS:

```css
.parent-element {
  position: relative;
}

.child-element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

> **Note** When using `position: absolute`, the browser calculates the position
> using top/left from the closest parent element that has a position specified â€”
> that's why in the example, we're specifying `position: relative` for the
> parent element. Check out the resources on positioning for more info on this
> if you're interested!

The work of calculating the absolute positions and creating CSS rules for a bunch of different kitten image elements has been done already. It's your job to use CSS selectors to apply the correct positioning to each of these elements.

Use the
comments in `css/place-kitty.css` to write the correct selectors to move each
kitty into the wheelbarrow.

# CSS Graffiti

## Objectives

- Use the browser developer tools
- Override existing styles

Imagine that you are walking down the street, and you notice that there's a
mural that has been painted over with various graffiti tags. In reality,
cleaning this up could be a challenging feat; however, in CSS, you have the
power to manipulate the DOM with just a line or two of code and to restore the
mural to its original look! In this lab, we've created a virtual wall. Using
only CSS, how can you remove the tags?

## Getting Started

Open 'CSS_Debrief/css-graffiti'

## Use the Browser Developer Tools

Assuming you have opened the index file in Chrome, Inspect the elements of the graffiti wall in the dev tools by hovering over and
clicking on nested elements. Take a close look at what's made available to you
in the dev tools pane. You can see which style sheets specific style
declarations live in, as well as create new styles on the fly. 

Now, make note of the CSS styles used to add graffiti tags (as background images) to the wall.


In the file `css/cleanup.css`, write selectors that have more specificity
(authority) than those that are showing the graffiti tags. 

To remove the tags, use the CSS declaration `display:none;`. It will change the
elements' previous display property value from `display: block` to
`display: none`, which will hide that graffiti.

For example, for "tag-1" the developer tools reveal that the style applying the
graffiti here is:

```css
.tag-1 {
  background: url(../images/tag-1.png) no-repeat;
  z-index: 7;
  display: block;
}
```

You'll need to override this by setting its display to `display: none;` instead.
We can do this by writing a selector statement that is more specific such as:

```css
#wall .tag-1 {
  display: none;
}
```

This selects elements with a class of "tag-1" that happen to also be inside an
element with an id of "wall". This is more specific, and therefore will override
the previous statement and hide the graffiti. For more info on how specificity
in CSS works take a look at: [Smashing Magazines What You Need to Know About CSS
Specificity][smash]. You can also take advantage of a [Specificity
Calculator][spec-calc] to assist with finding and understanding options for
overriding styles.

**Do not use the CSS `!important` value**!
